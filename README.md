## City Vehicle Data Pipeline

The City Vehicle Data Pipeline is designed to process and migrate JSON data from IoT devices (such as vehicle telemetry data) stored in an AWS S3 bucket to an Azure SQL Database. This data pipeline ensures smooth data ingestion, validation, transformation, and loading into the Azure environment for further analysis and reporting.

This repository contains the architecture and detailed explanation of the pipeline implementation.
